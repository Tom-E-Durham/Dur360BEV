## Abstract  
We present **Dur360BEV**, a novel spherical camera autonomous driving dataset featuring a **128-channel 3D LiDAR** and an **RTK-refined GNSS/INS system**, along with a benchmark for **Bird’s Eye View (BEV) map generation** using a **single spherical camera**. This dataset addresses the challenges of BEV generation by **reducing hardware complexity**, replacing multiple perspective cameras with a **single 360-degree camera**.  

Our benchmark includes **SI2BEV (Spherical-Image-to-BEV)**, a novel module that projects spherical imagery into BEV space with a **refined sampling strategy**, as well as an **adaptive Focal Loss** formulation to handle **extreme class imbalance** in BEV segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that **Dur360BEV** simplifies the sensor setup while achieving **competitive performance**.

## News
- [2025/01/27] Dur360BEV has been accepted by ICRA 2025.


## Sensor placement

Dur360BEV is equipped with a **spherical camera, 3D LiDAR, and a high-precision GNSS/INS system**, providing comprehensive environmental perception.

- **LiDAR**: [Ouster OS1-128 LiDAR sensor](https://ouster.com/products/os1-lidar-sensor/) with 128 channels vertical resolution
- **Spherical Camera**: [Ricoh Theta S](https://www.ricoh-imaging.co.jp/english/products/theta_s/) featuring a **dual 1/2.3" 12M CMOS sensor**, **1280 × 640** resolution, and **15 Hz capture frequency**
- **GNSS/INS**: [OxTS RT3000v3](https://www.oxts.com/products/rt3000-v3/) global navigation satellite and inertial navigation system, supporting localization from GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo, PPP and SBAS constellations

To do...

## Download Guidance
### Downloading the full dataset from Hugging Face
#### Prerequisites
- Before starting, ensure you have the [**Hugging Face CLI (huggingface_hub)**](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli) installed:

  ​	Install it via: ```pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"```

- Since the **Dur360BEV dataset** is a [gated (restricted access) dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-gated) on Hugging Face, you need to authenticate before downloading it. 

  - You first need a Hugging Face account. If you don’t have one, please register.
  - Authenticate via the command line **on the computer where you want to download the dataset** by entering: `huggingface-cli login`. Following the instructions of that command, and it will prompt you for your Hugging Face **Access Token**.
  - Open [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/l1997i/DurLAR) and login to your Hugging Face account. At the top of the page, in the section **“You need to agree to share your contact information to access this dataset”**, agree to the conditions and access the dataset content. If you have already agreed and been automatically granted access, the page will display: **“Gated dataset: You have been granted access to this dataset.”**

#### Download the dataset using scripts
We provide a [pre-written Bash script](dur360bev_hf_download_script.sh) to download the dataset from Hugging Face. You need to manually modify the **User Configuration (Modify as Needed)** section at the beginning of [dur360bev_hf_download_script.sh](dur360bev_hf_download_script.sh) to match your desired paths and features.

If you encounter any issues (e.g., network problems or unexpected interruptions), you can also modify this script to fit your needs. For example, if the extraction process is interrupted, you can manually comment out the dataset download section and resume from extraction.


> **Note**: The Hugging Face service may be restricted in certain countries or regions. In such cases, you may consider using a Hugging Face mirror (Hugging Face 镜像) as an alternative.

# Environment Setup  

To ensure reproducibility and ease of installation, we provide a structured virtual environment setup. This includes all required dependencies and the local `fisheye_tools` library.

### 🔐 Git LFS Notice

This repository uses Git LFS to manage large files (e.g. model checkpoints).

Please run the following before cloning or pulling:

```bash
git lfs install
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tom-E-Durham/Dur360BEV.git
cd Dur360BEV
```

## Virtual Envrionment setup
```bash
./script/setup_env.sh
```

# 📁 Dataset Setup

After downloading the dataset, follow these steps to place it correctly:

1. **Move the dataset folder** into the project directory:


2. **Move the dataset split file** [dataset_indices.pkl](Dur360BEV_dataset/dataset_indices.pkl) into the dataset's `metadata` folder:

This ensures the evaluation scripts can correctly access both the dataset and the split definitions.

# Reproducing the Models
We provide checkpoints for the two models from our paper.
## Evaluate our models
To reproduce the results in our paper, run the following scripts:
```bash
./scripts/eval_coarse_fine.sh
./scripts/eval_dense.sh
```
These scripts will load pre-trained weights and perform evaluation on the corresponding test set of our dataset.
